<h1>REUSE, RECYCLE, RELIVE</h1>
 <div class="text">For the rest of our school year, Anna, Margherita and I (Silvia) have decided to open a lunch club where students from classes MYP1, MYP2, MYP3 will be able to create fun crafts using recyclable materials that will be collected once every two weeks. Originally, we have planned to collect everything in the month of December and we planned to open our club earlier. Although because of the lockdown we had to go through we didn't have the chance to start anything. But once we'll be back, we'll be back stronger than ever. The club will be open every monday at the spanish room at 1:15 starting from the 18th of January. Until then, see you soon!</div>

<div class = "row"> Recycling is an act of discipline and respectn towards the environment and other creatures on this planet. It is based on reusing old items that are ment to be used only once so that we can keep our home clean. Most of the plastic goes to the landfills and it eventually ends up in lakes, rivers and seas damaging many marine and land creatures. As human beings, we shouldn't tollerate such disgusting behaviour. We should instead create something new from old things.</div>
